# Portability
A mod that adds portable things to MineClone (crafting table, backpacks, etc.)

Currently, all I've done is the crafting table, since most of the others would require me to research how to add inventories to non-node items (it's probably really easy, I just haven't done it yet).
I plan to add the following:
- [x] Portable Crafting Table
- [ ] Portable Ender Chest (probably pretty easy, since it doesn't have an inventory anyway)
- [ ] Portable Furnace/Smoker/Blast Furnace
- [ ] Backpacks (which I guess are basically just unplaceable shulker boxes)
- [ ] Portable Smithing Table
- [ ] Portable Anvil
- [ ] Portable Enchanting Table (this one would probably be the hardest. I either have to check for bookshelves near the player or make it upgradeable with bookshelves, maybe set a max level by upgrading, then cycle through levels by left-clicking?)
